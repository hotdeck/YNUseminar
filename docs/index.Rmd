# Visioning vs Land Use Models

.pull-left[
- **Visioning** is a community oriented planning technique used to identify regional land-use and transportation goals
- **Objectives**: Consensus-building of the region's future
- **Tools**: Sketch planning tools (Envision Tomorrow+, CommunityViz, ...), paper/tablet maps, lego bricks
- Primarily driving by user-controlled inputs
- Limited by the quality of the public involvement and consensus-building, the feasibility of the preferred scenario

# Visioning vs Land Use Models

.pull-left[
- **Land-Use Models** predict a region’s future spatial distribution of households and employment 
- **Objectives**: anticipating direct and indirect impacts of policies/planns/public investment
- **Tools**: UrbanSim, DRAM/EPAL, MetroScope, CubeLand, ...
- Primarily driving by base year conditions, scenario inputs, and model assumptions
- Limited by the quality of inputs and model assumptions

# Metro's Objectives of Applying Land Use Models

> Metro is responsible for **growth planning under Oregon law** and **transportation planning under federal law** for three urban counties in the Portland region.  Analytic support for those two processes requires forecasts of how much growth is likely to occur within the region’s Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) and where such growth is likely to occur at smaller-scale geographies.  The small-geography growth forecasts support transportation planning as inputs to transportation system performance forecasting.
